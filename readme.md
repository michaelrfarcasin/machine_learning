This folder contains a series of exercises I created for myself to demonstrate machine learning using Jupyter Notebook in Python.

I start using Tensorflow in exercise 6.

I worked on this as I went through [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (by Andrew Ng) on Coursera.
